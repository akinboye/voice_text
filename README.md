The provided code is a Python script that implements a simple speech-to-text and text-to-speech system using the speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries, with pyaudio as a dependency for microphone input. It listens to a user’s voice input through a microphone, converts it to text using Google’s Speech Recognition API, and then reads the recognized text back aloud using a text-to-speech engine.
